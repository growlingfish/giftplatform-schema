# GIFT Platform (DIY)

To enable an ecosystem of apps and services that can pass gifts from giver to recipient (and back), we provide the [GIFT Platform](https://toolkit.gifting.digital/gift-platform/): a data schema for "hybrid gifts", an API and content management system (CMS).

This WordPress database schema extends WordPress to support the GIFT Platform's CMS. Please see [https://toolkit.gifting.digital/gift-platform/diy-gift/](https://toolkit.gifting.digital/gift-platform/diy-gift/) for more details on applying this database definition while setting up your own private instance of the GIFT Platform.

To use the public instance of the GIFT Platform maintained by the GIFT project, please visit the [GIFT Toolkit](https://toolkit.gifting.digital/)

## The GIFT project

GIFT is a [research project funded by Horizon 2020](https://gift.itu.dk/), exploring hybrid forms of virtual museum experiences. The project brings together artists, designers, museum professionals and computer scientists to help museums create personal encounters with cultural heritage, both in physical and digital realms.
